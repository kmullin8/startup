### Elevator pitch
---
Tired of mindlessly scrolling? Put your knowledge to the test! **Trivia Challenge Leaderboard** is a fast-paced quiz game where you race against the clock to answer as many questions as possible. Each correct answer earns you points, and the more you get right, the higher you climb on the global leaderboard. With fresh trivia pulled from an external API and live leaderboard updates, youâ€™ll always have new challenges waiting for you. Can you outscore your friends and claim the top spot?

### Design

### Key features
---
- User Accounts: Register, log in, and save your progress.
- Trivia Gameplay: Timed rounds with points awarded for each correct answer.
- Dynamic Questions: Pulls trivia questions from a public trivia API.
- Global Leaderboard: Ranks players by score, stored in the database.
- Live Updates: Leaderboard updates instantly via WebSocket.
- Replayability: Always fresh trivia content with multiple categories and difficulties.

### Technologies
---
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

-HTML â€“ Structure the app with semantic elements like header, footer, navigation, forms (login), and main content areas (game + leaderboard).

-CSS â€“ Style the app with a modern look: responsive layout, colors, animations for timer countdown, and hover effects on answer buttons.

-React â€“ Build the app using React components. Use routing for navigation (Login, Game, Leaderboard pages). Use React hooks for timer countdowns, game state, and user interactivity.

-Service (Node.js/Express) â€“ Provide backend endpoints for:
    -Register/login/logout
    -Start trivia round (fetch questions from API)
    -Submit score
    -Get leaderboard rankings

-DB/Login (MongoDB) â€“ Store user accounts (securely hashed passwords) and game scores. Use queries to generate leaderboard rankings.

-WebSocket â€“ Broadcast leaderboard updates to all connected clients when a new score is submitted. Keeps the experience interactive and exciting.
